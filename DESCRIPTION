Description: 
    Provides an S4 class implementation for sparse numeric vectors to
    efficiently store and manipulate data with a high frequency of
    zero values. The package includes methods for standard arithmetic
    operations, calculating the Euclidean norm, and standardizing
    vectors while maintaining sparsity to optimize memory usage.
